## Paste from the command line üï∂Ô∏è

Windows includes `clip.exe` which can be used to copy from `stdin`, but has no equivalent program for pasting to `stdout`.
Pasterboy does exactly that.

I developed it for accessing the windows clipboard from Neovim in WSL, for an example on how to set that up see [here](https://github.com/willcassella/config/blob/master/WSL/vim_clipboard.vim).
